In this project, we developed an exam system prototype that would be very beneficial in the future for many sorts of educational institutions. Here, we have developed a Java GUI for ExamSystemGui that has two buttons. One button will say "*Teacher,*" and the other button will say "*Student*." When the teacher button is hit, a password prompt will appear. If entered correctly, the teacher can then construct questions that are saved in question files memory as question.txt. The password in this case will be "*admin.*" The student can then read the questions from questions.txt and submit them which will be saved in a directory called answers and file name will be saved in his "*ID*".txt for example *213-134-001.txt*
